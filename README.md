This project explored the AI-Powered Job Market Insights dataset from Kaggle, which contains 500 job records with details such as job title, industry, company size, location, AI adoption level, automation risk, required skills, salary, remote friendliness, and job growth projection. The goal was to understand how AI and automation are shaping todayâ€™s workforce and to identify which roles are most at risk or positioned for growth. The project followed a clear process: first cleaning and preparing the data, then exploring trends through EDA, applying regression, classification, clustering, and association rule mining techniques. From these steps, we found these evaluation results suggest that AI Adoption Score alone does not serve as a meaningful predictor of job growth in this dataset. Overall, the analysis indicates that more complex modeling using additional features may be necessary to effectively predict job growth, as AI adoption on its own does not sufficiently explain the variation in growth outcomes. Although we could draw complete conclusions we can point toward the need for upskilling, retraining, and proactive planning.
